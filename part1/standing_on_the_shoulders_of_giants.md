# Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

That introduction was a highly stylized version of the brief daze I went into when recently opening the packaging of my new Raspberry Pi 3. Just holding that little computer made me think about how far we've come in technology. This computer is entirely incomprehensible to me. Sure, at a high level I can name some of the components (I'm pretty sure that blob is the CPU - wait does this thing have a GPU?), and at the lowest level I might just be able to sketch out a diagram for a NAND gate, but putting it all together into a working computer that you can hold in one hand is truly a testament to the modern age.

The first question that comes to mind is "How can anybody possibly make anything this complicated from scratch?". The answer, of course, is that *they can't*. The majority of technological advancement thus far has been achieved, as Newton put it, by standing on the shoulders of giants. We take what exists, then we test, tinker and tweak it in the name of scientific understanding. We do this until there's no room for improvement (or until returns start to diminish), then all of a sudden there's a new breakthrough and the whole process repeats.

### The Law of Accelerating Returns

This is the foundation for Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns[^1]. Not only is the rate of technological progress exponential in nature, but the speed at which it's progressing is also exponential. When measuring technological progress, we often look to the simplest proxy - how fast can we compute things? Everybody has heard of Moore's Law[^2], but even before Integrated Circuits were a thing, technological progress has been increasing in the same way:

> It is important to note that Moore’s Law of Integrated Circuits was not the first, but the fifth paradigm to provide accelerating price-performance. Computing devices have been consistently multiplying in power (per unit of time) from the mechanical calculating devices used in the 1890 U.S. Census, to Turing’s relay-based “Robinson” machine that cracked the Nazi enigma code, to the CBS vacuum tube computer that predicted the election of Eisenhower, to the transistor-based machines used in the first space launches, to the integrated-circuit-based personal computer which I used to dictate (and automatically transcribe) this essay.

The underlying concept powering our progress as humanity is not just about getting faster, it's about getting faster at how fast we can get faster. Humanity is _so meta_. With hardware, this is simple to measure - are we able to produce a piece of technology which is twice as fast as it was last year? But if the Law of Accelerating Returns is driving the advancement of hardware, does it apply to software too? Or how about intelligence?

I started thinking about how the same principle applies to the advancement of software as well as hardware. With hardware, the path is clear. If you're 

Consistent abstractions in hardware allowing us to work on more complex problems
Mech -> Vacuumm -> Tape -> Circuits

Can't build on human brains iteratively - might be getting more intelligent but feedback loop (lifetime) too slow for quick progression. Instead, we can improve by creating abstractions, things other people figured out that you 'dont need to know'. Exhbit A; a kid can now buy a raspberry pi, hook it up to the internet

Abstractions in software allowing us to work well
Machine code -> Assembly -> C -> high level 

What is our Fifth Paradigm of advancement in software?

Next era of advancements in style, teaching, etc.
