# Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

That introduction was a highly stylized version of the brief daze I went into when recently opening the packaging of my new Raspberry Pi 3. Just holding that little computer made me think about how far we've come in technology. This computer is entirely incomprehensible to me. Sure, at a high level I can name some of the components (I'm pretty sure that blob is the CPU - wait does this thing have a GPU?), and at the lowest level I might just be able to sketch out a diagram for a NAND gate, but putting it all together into a working computer that you can hold in one hand is truly a testament to the modern age.

The first question that comes to mind is "How can anybody possibly make anything this complicated from scratch?". The answer, of course, is that *they can't*. The majority of technological advancement thus far has been achieved, as Newton put it, by standing on the shoulders of giants. We take what exists, then we test, tinker and tweak it until there's no more room for improvement. Then all of a sudden, there's a breakthrough and the whole process repeats.

### The Law of Accelerating Returns

This is the foundation for Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns[^1]. Not only is the rate of technological progress exponential in nature, but the speed at which it's progressing is also exponential.

Or as I like to put it; Shit is getting really cool even faster than it was before.

I started thinking about how the same principle applies to the advancement of software as well as hardware. 

Consistent abstractions in hardware allowing us to work on more complex problems
Mech -> Vacuumm -> Tape -> Circuits

Abstractions in software allowing us to work well
Machine code -> Assembly -> C -> high level 

Next era of advancements in style, teaching, etc.
