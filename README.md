# developing-for-humans
A guide for writing better code for the humans who read it.

TLDR: Programming will be the literacy of the 21st century. By writing code with humans in mind, we can teach better and faster, and more importantly, teach our students to do the same. We can enter a virtuous cycle of development to match the speed of hardware improvements.
